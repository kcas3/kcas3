### Welcome to my GitHub profile
- A little about myself
	- I am an IT Support Specialist
	- I am currently trying to reteach myself some of my long forgotten programming skills
	- I like to play and produce absolutely terrible sounding music, which you can probably find somewhere on my website
	- I'm sure more will get added to this eventually, but for now it's gonna be pretty bare
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a couple tools to make my life easier at work, but they are just theoretical and not really being implemented anywhere
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 3D modeling in Blender and teaching myself PowerShell
