### Welcome to my GitHub profile
- A little about myself
	- I am an IT Student and a Service Desk consultant at my University
	- I am currently trying to reteach myself some of my long forgotten programming skills
	- I like to play and produce absolutely terrible sounding music, which you can find somewhere on my website
	- I'm sure more will get added to this eventually, but for now it's gonna be pretty bare
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python web scraper for a capstone project in college (private repo for now but my segments may be unprivated at a later date)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 3D modeling in Blender and reteaching myself Python
