### Welcome to my GitHub profile
- A little about myself
	- I am currently an IT Support Specialist, currently trying to reteach myself some of my long forgotten programming skills
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a couple tools to make my life easier at work, but they are just theoretical and not really being implemented anywhere except on my local machine, if at all. Some of the repos are public, but they're pretty much CS101 levels of programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently teaching myself PowerShell for some stuff at work
